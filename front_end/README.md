## Registration App
The client is a web app developed using ReactJS and React-bootstrap components.
The client accepts patients registration with basic info: first name, last name, DOB, phone,
insurance and insurance id.

After user enters all the info and hit Next, a status page will show the registration status.

## Run application
### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


## Part2 development
In branch part1 I only use single component for the registration process. Further development 
separated it into two components, one is the registration form, the other is 
registration status. This new refactor was accomplished by using React props and router.
